- Learned to implement *transition, transform, and translateY( )* with *:hover* to create animation effects via CSS.
- Learned to implement *box-shadow* with *:hover and ::after* to make animation look more appealing via CSS. 
- Learned to write a function using *onclick, toggle and contains* methods to make a responsive opening and closing nav menu icons via JavaScript.

# My addition:
